# Energy is for p=1.02 (with p0=25.4 MeV/c) with 3% p-bite, so 6% E-bite
# This should be 3.13 MeV/c, with dE(FWHM?)=0.1878 MeV/c
# We see a lower initial energy and higher spread, presumably because of
# upstream material. These values are from the elog:206.
# For the beamwidth study, change EkinSpread by factor in file name.
# This is with a pbite spread 1.8 of canonical (0.20MeV->0.36MeV)
